# Neural Style Transfer Movie

!['resources/readme_clip.gif'](resources/readme_clip.gif)

## Project File Overview

- [`neural_style_transfer.py`](neural_style_transfer.py) main file for running your focus analysis.
- [`neural_video_creator.py`](neural_video_creator.py) main file for running your focus analysis.
- [`configs/config.json`](configs/config.json) a configuration file for your file paths and preferred visual settings

## Requirements

Youâ€™ll need the following:

- [Python 3.6.8](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-368/) (other Python 3 versions may work as well)
- Python's PIP package installer
- Two digital pictures
- A GPU is not required but it will greatly speed up your neural style transfer learning. Read about deep learning with GPUs here: https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-installation-guide-microsoft-windows/index.html

## Getting Started

Find two pictures you would like to perform style transfer on. It helps if one has more content/structure while the other is more artistic in nature.

The commands below are for Windows and my Python alias is "python" but yours may be "python3", "py -3", etc.

Make sure you have the virtualenv package in your global Python environment.

```
python -m pip install virtualenv
```

Move this project to its own folder and setup a virtual environment inside of it.

```
python -m venv env
```

Activate your virtual environment.

```
env/Scripts/activate
```

Install the project's dependencies into your virtual environment.

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run your neural style transfer program. We have only set the iters argument here but if you look in the file you will see many more options available. Your first pic should be the "content" image while the second one should be the "artistic" image.

```
python neural_style_transfer.py resources/kiss.jpg resources/warhol.jpg images/result --iter 1000
```

Modify the [`configs/config.json`](configs/config.json) file to adjust your settings and point to your relevant paths.

Run you neural video creator program.

```
python neural_video_creator.py
```
